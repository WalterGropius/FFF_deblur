# 🎯 FocusFrameFinder: Your AI-Powered Image Sequence Lifesaver! 📷💥





🔥 Welcome aboard! You've stumbled upon the **_FocusFrameFinder_** - your one-stop Python sidekick to conquer the world of blurry images in your sequences. Whether you're on a mission to generate top-notch Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) 🌌, creating eye-popping 3D models 🏞 from 2D images, or just decluttering your image library 🗃, we got your back!





## 🎢 What's The Ride About?

Dealing with blurry images is like having pineapple on your pizza 🍍🍕 - it's not for everyone. FocusFrameFinder uses the magic of the Variance of Laplacian (VoL) 🎩🔮 to quantify the blur in each image. Think of it as your very own image sorting hat 🧙‍♂️! This cool cat 🐱‍🏍 navigates through each image, calculates a 'Focus Measure' and sorts out the fuzzier ones to a different corner.



## 🚀 Features

1. **Smart Blur Buster** 🤓: Armed with the Variance of Laplacian method to quantify the blur.
2. **Automatic Sorting & Isolation** 🗂: Moves the blurry guys to their own sub-folder. Out of sight, out of mind!
3. **You're The Boss!** 🕹: Set your own threshold for what you consider too blurry.
4. **Stats Galore** 📊: Min, max, average, median - you name it! Helping you choose the right threshold.



## 💡 Perfect For...

- **Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)** 🌌: Only the best for your NeRFs!
- **Photogrammetry** 🗺: Your 3D models deserve sharp, clear images.
- **Image Library Cleanup** 🧹: Get rid of those blurry nuisances and enjoy your pristine image collection!

Say 👋 to blurry frames and let FocusFrameFinder handle the grunt work!
